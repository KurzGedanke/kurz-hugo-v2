# kurz-hugo

This is my personal written Hugo-Theme with the base of bootstrap. It is nothing fancy, but this was one part of it. Keep it simple and make it purple.

Despite of that this is theme is under an BSD-3 License, please don't use it as your own personal theme. You can use it, but please don't. Also it would be a pain because a lot of things are hard codes for my specific case. I'm complelty fine if you copy part of the code, or even change the colors. Thank you!

I'm by far not an hugo expert, but the writting gave me a little inside view of theming hugo (of course it does...), so if you want to write your own hugo theme and you don't know where to start, just ask away. I'm gald to help :)
